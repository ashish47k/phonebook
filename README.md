# C++ Phonebook Project

This is a simple C++ phonebook project I created as a beginner in 2021 when I was first learning the basics of C++. The project helped me understand fundamental programming concepts like file handling, data structures, and input/output operations in C++.

## Project Overview

The phonebook project allows users to store, search, and manage contact information (names and phone numbers) using a text-based interface. The contacts are saved in a `.txt` file, making it possible to retain data even after the program is closed. This was my first project that introduced me to handling files and strings in C++.

## Features

- **Add New Contacts**: Store new contacts with names and phone numbers.
- **Search Contacts**: Look up contacts by name.
- **Display All Contacts**: List all saved contacts from the phonebook file.
- **File Handling**: Contacts are stored in `phonebook.txt`, allowing persistent data storage.


### Compile and Run

1. **Compile the Code**:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o phonebook
    ```

2. **Run the Program**:
    ```bash
    ./phonebook
    ```

This will open the phonebook application in the terminal, where you can add, search, and list contacts.
